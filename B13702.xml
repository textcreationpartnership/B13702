            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE sinne of Sacriledge</hi> smitten of God by the Rod of his Lippes, and the Hand of his Iustice, is gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen so common, with the couetousnesse and carnalitie of the times, as now it seemeth to be very good in Law. <hi>Munus ofterrendi</hi> is worne out of date, and <hi>Munus auferrendi</hi> is by intrusion come into his office: in the which he layeth lustily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and playeth the man. <hi>Haec habui quae dedi,</hi> was the prouerbe of old. <hi>Haec habui quae edi,</hi> is the Adage that is now of this age of ours. The great <hi>Leuiathan</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:177638:3"/> it his pastime to swallow vp a Church, <hi>et lege agraria,</hi> to engrosse <hi>aedes et sedes,</hi> the Portion and Possession of the Lord, and to make the poore <hi>Leuite</hi> that serueth at the Altar, to lodge in the streetes. The Schoole of them is great; and the mischiefe they will doe, if they may haue their mindes, is more then easily any one can diuine. They proiect no lesse, then that Desolation should stand in the Holy place; and that the Land should be full of Darknesse and cruell habitation: that the Priestes lips (the preseruers of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) should be shut vp, and that the people crying for Bread, should haue none to giue it them. It is time the Lord should put to his hand, and haue mercie vpon <hi>Syon;</hi> yea, the time (I hope) is come, if not of building vp the decayed Walles, and of restitution of the Lords goodes: yet of preuenting the purposes of such nefarious violators of Holy thinges, who are so farre from repenting themselues of the euill already done, as they repine against vs that they can doe no more. This argument will be but bitter to their stomacks as Wormewood, and the very waters of Gall. I must not care for that: I am not a Cooke, <hi>Pulmentum praeparare,</hi> to make them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie
<pb facs="tcp:177638:3"/> Sauce. VVe are set by God, as Phisici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ouer you; so as I say with <hi>Augustine: Eligo aspera, sed salubria medicamenta,</hi> I choose you a bitter, but the better Potion. The region of this sinne being white, and readie for Haruest, and calling for a Sickle from Heauen to cut it downe, hath sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my Sickle, and made my Penne like the poynt of a Diamond, and hath enlarged my soule, in the anguish of my soule, for the wracke and hauocke made of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> not to speake in the milde voyce of <hi>Eli,</hi> but with a stronger cry, as <hi>Christ</hi> vsed at the raysing vp of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that had now in his Coffin entred into some degrees of corruptiō. For the VValles of <hi>Hierico,</hi> the VValles of this Sinne, will not come tumbling downe without the shrill voyce of Trumpets of Rammes hornes: Deafe Adders will diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly be charmed, and deafe and dumbe Spirites will not be cast out, without much Fasting &amp; Praying; all intention of minde, contention of Sinewes and Sides; all inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Argument is all too little for this Argument wee haue in hand. It is a hard Knotte in the Timberlogge, that must be often and forcibly driuen out by the Beetle:
<pb facs="tcp:177638:4"/> It is an extreame Disease, that requireth extreame remedies. <hi>Varium poscit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium diuersa qualitas passionum,</hi> sayth <hi>Gregorie;</hi> As the Passions differ in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so wee are to varie in the prescribed remedie. <hi>Hic lauacra mollia: ille ferrum quaerit ad vulnera;</hi> One Disease would be washed with Water, and be handled with a soft Hand; but an other must be launced with an Instrument, and seared with an hot Iron. This Sacriledge is a sore of such sort, that must be cut to the very quicke, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption thereof can not be let out with a Needle, but it must suffer a very deepe inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. I haue endeauoured to wound the very Scalpe of it, not thinking it enough to breake the Legges of these Thieues, as the Legges of the Theiues that were crucified with our Sauiour. These Meditations, as the whole man, are consecrated to your Grace, in a fitte time, to the ioy of many heartes raysed vp by God, for the buylding and beautifying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Lordes House that is at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in despight of all the Aduersaries to <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Beniamin, Sanballat,</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias,</hi> and all the froward fellowes beyonde the Riuer. I humbly beseech your Grace, to be
<pb facs="tcp:177638:4"/> pleased with this poore Oblation, the earnest Pennie of my duetifull deuotion: and as you haue graciously my vnworthy person, so the cause that will be worthy, to take into your protection, by sheilding it from the iniurie of the time, and the malice of mens mindes; and by giuing it such countenaunce, as the nature of it shall need. Thus, powring out my spirit vnto God for you, (as duetie deepely bindeth mee) that you may liue long, and see many good dayes; that by your good Learning, and godly Wisedome, the Vine of the <hi>English</hi> Church, may more flourish and spread abroad her Branches, to the glory of God, and the common good; in all duetifull affection, I commende your Grace to the protection and preseruation of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

            <p>The state Deliberatiue is this: The King bethinketh himselfe of the basenesse of Gods House, and would be at the cost to make it Beautifull: And hee hangeth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at the heeles of the cause, to make it weigh heauier, disputing, <hi>Ab honesto,</hi> from consequent of congruitie, that it should be so by way of double comparison, <hi>A minori, ad maius,</hi> from the lesser to the greater. 1. As by comparing himselfe with God: <hi>I dwell in a house. &amp;c. The Arke of God remaineth. &amp;c.</hi> 2. Next, by sampling his Court with Gods <hi>Arke;</hi> this basely drawen ouer with a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopie of <hi>Skinnes:</hi> the other studded and set out with <hi>Cedars.</hi>

            <p>The zeale of <hi>Dauid</hi> towardes God, not onely sheweth it selfe in this intention, but many wayes else in other of his actions. In the raigne of <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.

And that no man should thinke what the King did in this case, it was with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and counsaile of his Bishops, <hi>Sadoch</hi> and <hi>Abiathar;</hi> and that he entred not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such actions, by the priuiledge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of his Princely authoritie; or that his Ditties and Psalmodie were set foorth in the person of a Prophet, the case is very cleare: the Priestes being the occasion of the scorne that was then made of Religion, that
<pb facs="tcp:177638:10"/> the Tabernacle was broken and lost, that the Arke of God was out of the Temple, the proper place of it, and in priuate houses was obscured and hemmed in: that the people had no publique place of assemblie to heare the word of God, but that euery one had his Chappell &amp; Oratorie by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in Woods and Mountaines: all which abuses, crept into the Church vpon the desidiousnes &amp; negligence of the Priestes. Wherefore King <hi>Dauid</hi> cyted and summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Bishops and Priestes, and the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of that time, to appeare before him; tolde them what wracke Religion had sustained, and how hardly it fared; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Arke to be remoued to <hi>Syon,</hi> and himselfe was present to see it perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

            <pb facs="tcp:177638:11"/>
            <p>King <hi>Salomon</hi> did build the House to the Lord, which <hi>Dauid</hi> had proiected, &amp; made a famous oration to the people touching the worship of God and Religion; depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Bishop <hi>Abiathar</hi> from his place,<note place="margin">2.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Chro. 29.</note>When the Temple was filthily defiled through the sloath and sinfulnesse of the Priestes,<note place="margin">1. Chro 28.</note>

            <p>The Publicke seruice of God hath this comfort, that the thinges that are prayed for, are approoued as needfull by generall iudgement, while we heare them with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent desired. Such places serue to sharpen the edge of thy deuotion, when it turneth aside, and waxeth dull to any good action.

Hence is it, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> is such a votarie to God:<note place="margin">Psal. 26.12. Psal. 35.18.</note>

            </p>
            <p>But what of all this, may some say? How maketh this matter for materiall Churches? The presence of a Christian people where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer assembled, the offices of Religion performed among them, making the place of their assemblie publicke, as the presence of the Prince and his followers, maketh any mans priuate House a Court? But herein they doe but dreame (by their leaue:) not the Assemblie, but the Assigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the place to such publicke ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; being that which properly maketh it publicke.

               <note place="margin">2.

            <p>After the subuersion of this first House,<note place="margin">Ezr. 3.12.</note> a second was set vp in the same place; but so disproportionable and different from the former,<note place="margin">Agg. 2.4.</note> as hee that had seene the beautie of
<pb facs="tcp:177638:26"/> the one, rued the base and vild aspect of the other: yet was it not so simple, but that it might be the Dyamonde of the Ring, and the Wonderment of the World, for beautie and Maiestie.</p>
            <p>After the edifying of this Temple, in length of time, were many Synagogues set vp. <hi>Paulus Fagius</hi> recounting the number of them, maketh the totall summe, Foure hundred, in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Temple, and these Synagogues, Christ himselfe, &amp; his Apostles, often came. The number of Christians waxing dayly beyond number, caused the distinction of Assemblies and Churches, one place bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not of capacitie for the companie. This easily will appeare by computing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie that were in the greater Cities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of the first 200. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ, by considering the feruor and quicknesse of the times wherein they liued: or obseruing the condition of the Place where they kept: what troupes &amp; traines, flockes and swarmes of people before the yeares before named were expired, were to be seene in those famous Cities, <hi>Rome, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4.4. Act. 2.41.</note>
               <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and such like; it is not hard to coniecture and conceiue by the encrease which a few weekes wrought, after the death of Christ; when the Preachers made a Purchase of Three thousand Soules at
<pb facs="tcp:177638:26"/> once conuerted in one day.</p>
            <p>Now at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Platina ex Damasco.</note> about the Hundred yeare after Christ, the Congregation became so huge, the people drawing themselues from all quarters thither; as <hi>Euaristus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for auoyding of confusion, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned to deuide and part them into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Parishes; assigning seuerall Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ouer them: Neither could the nature of the times agree with one Vniuersall and generall Assemblie; the Sword of the Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie being so sharpe and so sore against them; whereby they were constrayned to hide their heades in desolate places.</p>
            <p>Finally, the places where they mette by stealth, as priuate Houses, Vaultes, and such like, could not admit of any great number. These were good reasons to distribute the people, and to limit them their boundes, by appoynting them their proper Parish-churches. I graunt, that the Church which was at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which receiued that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which Statute Lawes did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, were enforced to seeke Priuate places for the exercise thereof;<note place="margin">Act. 1.13.2.1.2.46.</note> such as were most safe, though not so sutable to their seruice.</p>
            <p>They came to the Temple &amp; Synagogue of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> but to execute the dueties of their callinges, as they were Christians, they were to seeke out by and desolate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At length betweene times, through
<pb facs="tcp:177638:27"/> conuiuencie and sufferaunce; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through fauour, licence, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they also began to reare vp Oratories and Churches, though but meane, because their estate was meane; a good meane to stoppe the perill of malignitie, that would otherwise ensue of it.</p>
            <p>But as the Church grew in age, and loue with Religion, they loued nothing more then to build Churches, and to haue them most in admiration, of whom they could say, <hi>These are the men that haue built vs Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</hi> The deuotion that <hi>Dauid</hi> in his time with such pleasure did behold in the <hi>Iewish</hi> people, to contribute to a Temple, waxed common among Christians, vnder their godly Kinges and Emperours. So as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were euery where erected, no cost spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a <hi>Nemo scit,</hi> as in the dayes of <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> when the Tabernacle was set vp, was chearefully presented.</p>
            <p>If we should runne through the Classies of all times, I know not when to end with examples of this sort. It is necessarie that the Place for the seruice of God, should be Publique for the auoyding of Priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles; which howsoeuer they be muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with the Handkerchiefe and Vaile of Pretended Religion, may serue to plot and prosecute very dangerous machinations: Yea, albeit they often serue for the best pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb facs="tcp:177638:27"/> yet easily may they hurt, as well in regard of the fitnesse of them for Hereticks to scatter the filthy foame of their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diuinitie; aswell for that they make as an occasion to traduce and haue in suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holy actions; which being so sacred in themselues, should be so handled, as they might not be subiect, not so much as by any probable shew to such imputations; which respects should haue the more weight with vs, in as much as the Church hath had such quicke and sensible experience of these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes, when Christians were enforced, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing noe other remedie, all Temples being shut vp against their Religion, to seeke out secret places for the performance of duties of Deuotion: which serue to confute our brainsicke <hi>Anabaptistes,</hi> who runne from our Churches, as <hi>Iohn</hi> from the Bath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Cerinthus</hi> washed himselfe. <hi>Elias</hi> and his people praying in one place, and they and their sectaries in an other by themselues. Thus rending the Vaile of the Temple in twaine, and miserably manckeling the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Christ, which was without seame.</p>
            <p>I should heere leaue this poynt, as alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die illustrated with proofes sufficient: but that it is needfull I should encounter cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine skilfull persons, that vnder colour of Religion, hotly plead for the ouerthrow of Churches, as formerly stained, and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<pb facs="tcp:177638:29"/> companions in the like case: When as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> had found out a vacant and conuenient Place in the Citie, where they might seate &amp; set vp a Church, and there were Victualers that made claime and title vnto it, as being in the veine to vent their commodities, and to serue for the Shambles: The Emperour, though an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, yet led by Natures direction, could answere them; <hi>Jt is better that God should be worshipped any way, then that you should haue your way:</hi> Meaning, that it were better to be Superstitious, then Prophane: to which sentence, I subscribe.</p>
            <p>Now for the grounds of Scripture which they haue layde, whereupon to builde their cause, they are very weake, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more affinitie betweene those times, and ours, that people and vs, then there is betweene <hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle, and <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> For the precept gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out against <hi>Canaan,</hi> toucheth not vs; wee are there informed how it seemeth good to God, to proceed against them: but it serueth not as a forme, for vs to follow coerciuely against such Idolatrie in others. The <hi>Jsraelites</hi> were restrained from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and couenantes of peace, with the inhabitantes and people of that place: shall wee therefore collect and conclude from thence, the vnlawfulnesse of Commerce,
<pb facs="tcp:177638:30"/> League, and Stipulation betweene those of the aduerse, and true Religion?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> were to roote out the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> is it therefore a consequent by way of comparison, that the reformed Churches should put to the sword, all the whole sect and societie of such as are mongers of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie? The intention of that prescription and precept against the Oratories of the <hi>Cananites</hi> for the seruice of their false Gods,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.2.</note> was to haue but one place, which should be the publique Parish of the Land, to which all the people should customably repaire and bring their Presentes of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Oblations, according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the law Leuiticall.</p>
            <p>The example of the practise of the two Kinges, <hi>Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> hath not the vigor and power that hath precept: Examples being not of commaunding kind, and of the force of Lawes that are binders. Examples are Counsailers, but no Commaunders. They serue to direct, but not to draw vs: they are Lessons, but no Lawes: neither are they Lessons but in like causes, as fayling where proportion and equalitie fayleth; as it doth in the instance betweene them and vs. For their Groaues and High-places were dangerous through the iust feare of secret accesse, that the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious sort would haue vnto them. As for
<pb facs="tcp:177638:30"/> vs, we are in securitie, and on the surer side; our Churches being clensed throughly of the corruptions of former Superstitions, and being onely open to the onely pure Religion: yea being euery way so proper to this Holy vse, great pittie were it that any of them should be diuerted and turned to any other purpose: Wherefore in all Common-wealths and Prouinces, that haue giuen passage and protection to the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; the Churches that heretofore serued to Idolatrie, haue been reteined; only the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars defaced and done away, as the learned man (<hi>Zanchius,</hi> with approbation) doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue:<note place="margin">Zanch. de operibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptionis. lib. 1. cap. 12.</note>

            <p>According to the Legall prouision, the Churches which formerly haue been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to superstition, haue now passed through the fire of the Word of God; the Word of God therein now being sincerely and vncorruptly deliuered.<note place="margin">Cod. lib. 1.

            <p>But the time is yet to come, to bring in their proofes for such fault as they haue layde vpon the state of our Churches; for which cause they pursue with such hotte contention, their vtter desolation.</p>

            <p>But heere an Obiection wilbe laide in by some; that God was neuer better serued, then when his Churches were no better
<pb facs="tcp:177638:38"/> then poore mens Cottages, as more sutable to the simple nurture of the Gospell?</p>
            <p>To this I answere, that one and the selfe same worke is often done to diuers endes. The masse of mony laid out by <hi>Herod</hi> about the Temple, was out of the pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of his minde: Whereas <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> in the like endeauours, were in their affections, Pious and Religious. What intent soeuer wee bring to such thinges, it is nothing derogatorie from the thinges themselues. God at no time hath yet told vs so much of his minde, that his fancie standeth more to the building that is base, then to that which is beautifull: and that he will not haue his seruice else where, then in an homely House. God neuer hath been more honored, then when the vtmost Costes haue been bestowed vpon his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Temple. And this rather agreeth with the state and magnificence of Iesus Christ, and the sublimitie of the Gospell: vnlesse we will thinke as basely of Christ, and as abiectly of his Gospell; as in times past the great men about <hi>Julian</hi> did. When in the times of a generall Persecution, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to the Church, that their seruice in their Temples was not so solemne, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearable to the honour and maiestie of God: answere was made thus: The best Temples that we can dedicate to God, are
<pb facs="tcp:177638:38"/> our sanctified soules and bodyes.</p>
            <p>Thus when their estate would not suffer them to haue stately Churches: the chiefe Fathers contented themselues in the grace of God, as equally affected to materiall Temples, either sumptuous or simple. But when they were growne to be in better case, their Churches became very costly and curious.</p>
            <p>If such liberalitie belongeth to Churches,<note place="margin">Of the liberall maintenance, due to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Church.</note> how much more ought the same to be she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed towards the Ministers of the Church? The neglect whereof hath made a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of contemptible Clergie-men; for which our name is in obloquie with stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: the base maintenaunce that is made them fraying them of better marke from this function, whereby the Church dores are set wide open, to those that are of base and vnworthy condition.</p>
            <p>It was wofull with the <hi>Leuites</hi> in the old Testament,<note place="margin">Iud. 19.1.8 &amp; 17.8.6.</note> when their bare Meate and Drinke, a single and simple Suite of Appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and ten Sicles of Siluer was the yearely Pension of their paines: when as they might take vp a lodging in the Streetes, for want of better vse and fauour they could finde: Yet this somewhat salueth the sore; that there was then, no King in <hi>Jsrael,</hi> but euery one did that which was good in his owne eyes. But wee hauing Kinges to
<pb facs="tcp:177638:39"/> raigne ouer vs, and not knowing what an <hi>Anarchie</hi> or <hi>Interregnum</hi> meaneth: Is it not inexcusable that Couetousnesse should get such footing into the Church, as to wipe the Ministers of their Maintenaunce, God of his Allowance the people of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all food of their Soules, and the Poore of the Repaste they should haue for their Bodyes?</p>
            <p>Though our Names in the writinges of the House of <hi>Israel</hi> be great; yet are wee by Nature, but Flesh and Blood as others; and therefore to be tolled on with Rewardes, as others, the best Mediators and Solliciters with such natures.

The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of these men, lyeth in their Larder-house, the Kitchin is their Conscience, and their Gutte is their God; they are meerely Fleshly, and haue not the Spirit.

            <p>But these companions the <hi>Catabaptistes</hi> of our time, with whom hitherto we haue had conflict, may happily obiect against that which hath thus been treatised, the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those two Worthies, <hi>Nehemias,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul: Paul</hi> making the hard labour of his hands, the Porter that brought in his liuing; for so was his protestation before a <hi>Synod</hi> and <hi>Conuocation</hi> of Bishops,<note place="margin">Act. 20.34.</note>

            <p>This Obiection is but idle and addle, and is scattered like foame. The examples of
<pb facs="tcp:177638:46"/> them both are nothing lesse then generall, as particular to the nature of those times wherein they liued, &amp; in that sort singuler. It is a grosse and impudent opinion, vnder the pretence of these two Presidentes, and shrowde of such examples, to euict this consequent, that all Ministers in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are to be put to the manuall Trades, to prouide for themselues. <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ministers cannot possibly set their heads and handes to worke togeather; that is, they can not read it, and trade it; be <hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> and <hi>Aratores;</hi> be Preachers, and Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; be Teachers, and Tent-makers, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they had the extraordinarie dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Preaching and Prophecying, and knowledge of the Word, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had, when he laboured with his handes, and liued by his worke. Neither did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> euer denie, that hee at any time receiued Wages of the Churches: but this is all he sayd, that he did forbeare to charge them when as it was so meete for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church. So the poore estate of the people at that present, was that which wrought in the bowelles of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:177638:46"/> take that pittie in a pietie toward them.</p>
            <p>What? are the Ministers to be rancked among Theeues and Robbers in demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and exacting such Maintenaunce from the people, as is due by desert vnto them?</p>
            <p>Who so list to see further discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this cursed crew wee haue thus coupled with; I referre him to the second Booke and seauenth Tractate of M. <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tabaptistes.</hi> And thus haue wee mousled the mouthes of these Miscreantes.</p>
            <p>But now wee are to single out the second sort of Aduersaries to the Ministers main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to gaincope them as wee can. And they are those who making the same a simple Ceremonie, recke nothing at all of Conscience or Pietie. We shal determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, that it is not a case of custome, but Conscience, to pay their Tythes vnto the Church; the Tenth being the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Tribute, and the very Wages of the Lordes Workeman. And that it is as foule a sinne to defraude him in this duetie, as it is to detaine the Meate or the Monie of the labouring man.</p>
            <p>And first,<note place="margin">The reason of the institution of Tythes.</note> this very manner of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is by Tithes, is not without present and very good admonition, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the primitiue institution thereof;
<pb facs="tcp:177638:47"/> that is, that the people might acknowledge their dependant estate, vpon the blessing of God, vpon the labours of their handes, holding thus in <hi>Capite</hi> all their whole estate: and therefore that in iustice and very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, they can doe no lesse then to offer the tenth portion of Gods benediction, to the supportation and continuation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Wherefore our answere touching the payment of Tythes, is affirmatiue, and is this; That Diuine law would so haue it, that Equitie so requireth it, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the conseruation of the Ciuill socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it should be so.</p>
            <p>But as we know that this Law of Tythes hath been enterteined of the morer Nations by their voluntarie consent: so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, wee are not to learne, how some haue arraigned the Exaction of this duetie of absolute Iniquitie. Of this side are all such as are of the Schismaticall &amp; seditious sect, that breake through the Ranckes and Classes of all order, who neither would pay their taxe or tribute to <hi>Caesar;</hi> or otherwise the iust Debt they owe vnto their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, were it in their power. But in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and infected singularitie, hungry of nouelties, would take away both Celestiall and Ciuill Lawes from the heart and nauell of humane societie; wee haue also Diuines of no vsuall Learning, who checke our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb facs="tcp:177638:47"/> denying Tyths to haue ground and foundation, by Diuine ordination: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that their prerogatiue hold vpō Law that is positiue: and others would haue them to be otherwise ordained. Wherefore I consider how warily I must walke, that I giue no conuinence or countenance to the insolent neighberhood, to open a casement to let in innouation, neither that I go about to incircle the simple, or to lay Snares for the weaker Consciences: And finally, that good Men, Cities, and States may not be debarred or defrauded of their right.</p>
            <p>Now to open the Veine of this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the better, though all that they say, are not the rules of our Iudgement, we wil first haue the verdict of the Ciuill Lawyers, so farre foorth as it may duely be admitted. And first,<note place="margin">§. 1. De Dec. Decima est omniū bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mobillū licitè quaesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum pars decima, Deo data, diuina constitutione debita.</note> their definition they giue of Tythes, maketh much for our side: for thus they define them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Tyth is the tenth part of all moueable Goodes lawfully gotten, giuen vnto God, and due by Gods ordinaunce.</hi> But this last clause wee qualifie and helpe by distinction of the threefold Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> which is partly <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> partly <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> and partly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi> That the Ceremonis are voyded by the comming of Christ, wee are taught by the Apostles, and Christ himselfe: Those of the Iudicialles, that concerne the Politique
<pb facs="tcp:177638:48"/> and Ciuill gouernment, may be vsed, or refused as vse may permit, there is none but doe acknowledge it. But the Moralles are binders and standers, and are neuer out of date. Now the Law of Tything, seemeth to be compounded and confected of them all, and to be a medlie of them.</p>
            <p>The Morall part, is the Equitie of the Law which is perpetuall; that as the <hi>Leuitu</hi> then liued of the Tenth, so no lesse reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and deduction at all times is to be made for the Minister of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>The Iudiciall part was in this; that by this Law, Equalitie was preserued among the Tribes of this people; that whereas no Land came to the <hi>Leuites</hi> share, when as the Kingdomes of <hi>Canaan</hi> were deuided among the Tribes; the Tenth part set out for them out of euery Tribe, made their Estate and Maintenance proportionall.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Ceremonie of the Law was in this; Because the Tenth was due to the Priestes and <hi>Leuites</hi> for their seruice at the Altar, &amp; as an appurtenance to their Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; in which respect, we cannot vphold the custome of Tythes, the Priesthood of the Law being quite abolished.</p>
            <p>In the state of the Question that wee are to decide,<note place="margin">What we call properly Tythes.</note> whether Tythes be still payable by the Law of God, or not; we onely take them for proper and true Tythes, which
<pb facs="tcp:177638:48"/> are bequeathed to God out of our moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Goodes, indifferently deuided into the Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:177638:49"/> None of <hi>Moses</hi> Lawes which are onely of <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> or <hi>Iudiciall</hi> nature,<note place="margin">The Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are made against tythes, as not due by Gods law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> do in al things charge, binde, and concerne vs that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospell. But this Law of Tything, is <hi>Mosaicall,</hi> and hath reference alone to the <hi>Iudicials</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> Wherefore they hold not with vs, and our times.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> or Assumption of this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme, that Tythes are <hi>Mosaicall,</hi> and of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> or <hi>Iudicials</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> they thinke they stoutly prooue, in that they finde this Text in <hi>Leuiticus. All the Tythes of the seede of the land,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leuit. 27.30.</note>
               <hi>and of the Fruites of the Trees, are the Lordes; they are holy vnto the Lord.</hi> Now this they make a Case either of <hi>Ceremonie</hi> or <hi>Iudgement,</hi> or otherwise a Compound of them both, in as much as reason Naturall, aswell admitteth of the Eleuenth part, as of the Tenth: And therefore, that Christians are not by Law compellable vnto Tythes; or that the sayd Law extendeth vnto them, they peremptorily doe conclude.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, they reason against vs in this wise. Such Preceptes and Burthens as neither Christ nor his Apostles haue layde vpon our neckes, wee stand not bound to beare: But this burthen of Tything, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ nor his Apostles haue imposed vpon vs; wherefore wee Christians are not charged with them.</p>
            <p>The Assumption of this Reason, they
<pb facs="tcp:177638:49"/> would countenaunce by these Authorities, and Suffrages of Scriptures; as where Christ sayth:<note place="margin">Math. 28.</note>
               <hi>Teaching them to keepe all such thinges as J haue commaunded them.</hi> As where S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith:<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note>
               <hi>J haue shewed vnto you the whole counsaile of God.</hi> But in all the Wordes and Writinges of Christ, or his Apostles, there is no Commaundement touching Tythes to be found. And whereas some insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seemeth to be made thereof in this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of inuectiue of Christ against the <hi>Pharises. Woe be vnto you, for yee Tyth Mynt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 23.</note>
               <hi>Anisse, Comin; but yee neglect the greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law: those thinges yee ought to haue done; but not to haue left the other vndone.</hi> These Words, they tell vs, must be restrained to that time that the Law was in vertue and vigor among them: Wherefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That Christians are wronged, that are tyed to Tythinges.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it seemes to them indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and iniquitie, that such as are not vnder Law, but vnder Grace; should be vrged to those yoakes, of which they were free, that liued before the Law. But such bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage (say they) is brought on vs, by the payment of Tythes: Wherefore such a Rule so contrary to right, is to be reuersed.</p>
            <p>The first part of this Argument, they take to be perspicuous, in as much as wee Christians haue now, <hi>in re,</hi> those Graces of
<pb facs="tcp:177638:50"/> God, which our Forefathers enioyed but <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>spe.</hi> What they had onely in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wee Christians, haue in full and plena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie possession.</p>
            <p>The Second part of the Reason they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thus; In as much as before the times of the Law, Tythes as a duetie, could not be demaunded: but that whereas <hi>Abraham</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d pay them to <hi>Meicheze<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h,</hi> it was free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not forcedly. And whereas <hi>Iacob</hi> in the like, became a votarie, it was not absolutly, but conditionally. Hereupon they giue vs admonition of caution, that we doe not by this Introduction of Tythes, make the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times of the New Testament more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous then the old by our owne Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They yet discharge more shot against the body of this cause; and thus they doe dispute.</p>
            <p>The people of the old Couenant, were principally charged with Tythes of foure sortes. 1. Of the first kind were they, as were payable by the people indistinctly to the <hi>Leuites.</hi> 2. Of the second propertie were such, which were deducted from these Tythes of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> and to be leuied for the High-priestes. 3. Of the third quality were such, which euery one of the people seuerally layde aside for the furnishing of Feastes when they should be at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:177638:50"/> to which the Priestes were solemnely inuited. 4 The last were all such, which were euery third yeare, gathered for the reliefe of Strangers, the Fatherlesse, and Widowes. But wee that are vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, are not bound to the second third or fourth kind of Tythes; and therefore not to the first.</p>
            <p n="5">5. An other of their speciall Reasons is this; Were Tythes payable, and due by the Law of God, they should be euery where due; and he should sinne grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that should any way detaine them: But many Countries and Common-wealths are not acquainted with this fashion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not due by Diuine iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Againe, they put on thus; What thinges soeuer are vnder the same kind, are vnder the same Canon: But Tythes, First fruites, Oblations, are vnder the same kind; Wherefore, First fruites and Oblations, are as well to be commaunded by Canon, as Tythes: which to graunt, is to open a broad Dore to let in all the Priest-hood of <hi>Moses,</hi> and againe to bring our selues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that bondage from which by the Gospel we are deliuered.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Finally, they would thus conclude the cause against vs. It seemeth that to be iniustly of others demaunded, which being
<pb facs="tcp:177638:51"/> giuen to others, is so vsually to badde endes and purposes diuerted: but how wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly the Bishops and Priestes haue abused their Tythes, in the greatest part, none can be ignorant: Wherefore it were better they were left to their owners, then so shamefully to be wasted by such misgouernours. Thus fulnesse of Bread (forsooth) hath made the Children of the House, wanton; and therfore without more adoe, it may be taken from them, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to Dogs; Reuenewes haue ranckel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Religion; and Tythes in Gods sight, are of no better reckoning, then the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed Blood of Goates.</p>
            <p>Many more of their queint conceites might heere haue been remembred, which the Schoole of <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> hath published. But these are the mainest among many; &amp; the choisest of the companie, which we are now to scatter like foame, and to turne into Spiders webbes, and that in that order, which we haue propounded in the part of the aduersarie.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The first Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiō against Tythes, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note>To their first Reason, we lay in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: Wee cannot allow simply of their <hi>Maior</hi> Proposition, or wholly admit of it; but some distinction therein must be vsed. For as we doe not renew repealed Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, so we cannot yeeld to this; that such cyuill Ceremonies, as were in times of old
<pb facs="tcp:177638:51"/> prefixed and prescribed to the <hi>Iewish</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are vniuersally reuersed: but wee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppose and determine with our selues, that such as appertaine to any Magistracie, or estate are necessarilie to be kept. For whatsoeuer ordination or function is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed or deducted from <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> vpon any certaine or necessarie ground, to some proper respect had to any policie; the same as proper &amp; peculiar to that place, hath the force &amp; power of a binding Law, and may not with a safe Conscience of any of the sayd Subiectes, be voyded or viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For what shal let the Politique powers to take Lawes from whence they list, as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did frō the <hi>Athenians,</hi> &amp; the Cities of <hi>Germanie</hi> from the <hi>Venesians?</hi> Now <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> is no meane and ordinarie Law-giuer, but is easily the best of the Bunch, if you shall sute, sort, and sample him with <hi>Theseus, Romulus, Minos, Numa, Solon, Lycurgus,</hi> and the rest that are of that rancke; Nay the Lawes then giuen to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> heerein espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially doe commend themselues, that they hold in <hi>Capite,</hi> and haue the God of Heauen, himselfe the founder of them, to the vse of his owne People, his royall Nation, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Inheritance. In regard whereof, I see no cause why wee should so litle esteeme of them, or esteeme at all of this <hi>Maior</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, of this their first Syllogisme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb facs="tcp:177638:52"/> vnto vs For the <hi>Minor</hi> or assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sayd Syllogisme, wee partly doe accept it, and in part reiect it. Wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that the Precept of Tythes is <hi>Mosaicall,</hi> so farre foorth as by <hi>Moses the Minister and Messenger betweene God and them,</hi> it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and deliuered. But as <hi>Moses</hi> had this immediatly in commandement from God, we cannot but arbitrate it to be of Diuine condition. And whereas our Aduersaries would put by the Moralitie thereof, while they behold how naturall Reason standeth for the Eleuenth, as for the Tenth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in this wee cannot agree, or ioyne with them. For the charge concerning Tythes, is for the most part, meerely Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as implying and hauing this reason in it, suggesting the needfull maintenance of such, by the publique charge, who haue imployed their labours and endeauours vpon the seruice of the publique Estate; which not obscurely the Scripture doth signifie,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> the Lord himselfe thus speaking by <hi>Malachie: Bring yee euery Tyth into my Grauarie or Store-house, that there may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision in my House.</hi> Which Reason is assumed and confirmed by Christ and his Apostles. By Christ in this sentence of Iudgement he awardeth:<note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note>
               <hi>The laborour is worthy of his hyre.</hi> By S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who taketh the same Text from Christes mouth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9</note> and schoolieth and varieth
<pb facs="tcp:177638:52"/> vpon it, as you may see in his first Epistle and ninth Chapter to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by many instances and resemblances. Yea this Reason went for currant in the World, who albeit they layde out their Tythes to Impostors and Deceiuers; yet to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and true Preachers of the Gospell, they gaue stipend and maintenance, as their due allowance. Wee doe easily acknowledge, that this Law of Tything, in respect of the kind of it, is to haue place among the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialles. But if the Christian Gouernour shall rather thinke good of the Tenth part, then of the Eleuenth, to be payde to the Ministers, wee are to stand to that order as by his meanes now retayning the strength &amp; vertue of a ciuill Sanction. And so much shall suffice as a Surioynder to this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme.</p>
            <p>In their Second Argument as erroneous and false, we denie the Assumption,<note place="margin">The second Obiection answered.</note> which denieth the Ordination of Tythes to haue any allowance by Law giuen by Christ, or any his Apostles. For it is not absolutely without Authoritie in this case, for to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this they say; that Christ hath not strictly tyed vs to a number, yet that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Liuing should be layde out to the Ministers, though neuer so large is a poynt by him adiudged and determined. And so much in the former Answere hath been
<pb facs="tcp:177638:53"/> prooued out of this Mandate in the 10. of <hi>Mat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> and further concluded by the same Canon; inculcated by the Apostle, in his first letter to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> in the 9. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. At what time our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles preached and planted the Word in <hi>Iurie,</hi> all the Tythes then were in the handes of the <hi>Pharises;</hi> which could not by any colour of Law be taken away from them by priuate men; such as Christ and his Apostles seemed then to be. Otherwise without question, had they surrendred vp the Temple to Christ, and submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto the Ministers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, all the Tythes hand-smooth had been diuerted by them, to the common Godly vses of the Churches, Schooles of Learning, and to the Tables and Almes for the poore. But whereas neither the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Tythes would preach, neither would depart with their Tythes to such as were Preachers; it came afterwardes to passe not without the iust iudgement of an angrie God, that <hi>Nero</hi> then holding the Scepter of the Empire, and <hi>Felix</hi> being the subordinate Gouernour vnder him; that the Priestes were depriued of their Tythes by the Bishoppes, who forcibly tooke them out of their Barnes, whereby many of them through famine perished; which hurlie burlie and ryot, <hi>Eusebius</hi> remembreth and

               </gap>th sentence on our side in the Law and right of payment of Tythes. For by the Altar the Priest-hood is meant: and by the Fruites and Profites of the Altar, the Tythes are vnderstood. And truely the Apostle there reasoneth the matter from the Holy thinges and place that is Holy, to the Ministrie of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: as also from the Sacrifices and that part of the Sanctuarie which is the Altar, to the due maintenance accrewing to the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster by his labours in the Gospell. Which is argument euident enough, that it fareth as well with his liking, that the Ministers of the New Testament, as they of the Old, should haue their set and semblable allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whereupon to liue.</p>

                  </gap> 3. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweared.</note> wee say to them: First, those Fathers in these Primitiue times, before the Law was giuen them, had many thinges in vse, which were not so answearable to the Christian perfection, which Christ hath enioyned, and which in
<pb facs="tcp:177638:54"/> processe of time by Law were inhibited, and at the last, by Christ reformed. But we say also, that they had many things, which by degrees in the fulnesse of time, God brought into the World; so as their times were the initiation &amp; imitation of mans life.</p>
            <p>Wee haue further and fuller to answere, that in the age they liued, there was no such need that any Prouiso or Law should be made of Stypend, for the stay and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Clergie, in asmuch as the first borne were then Priestes, who by the right and prerogatiue of their birth, had a double part and portion of inheritaunce. Now the examples wherewith they furnish their Argumentes, seeme rather to commaunde then countermaunde Tything. For if the Fathers then in those first times, either vowed or performed Tythes to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, who then stood in no such need of them, hauing of their owne enough to liue by, and hauing no charge and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for Tything; much more should Christians with more chearely mindes, pay their Tithes to such as without such helpes cannot continue their labours in Gods Vineyard; especially for that Christ and his blessed Apostles doe not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and commaund this care vnto vs, but vrge them and perswade them by promise of reward to be awarded towardes them
<pb facs="tcp:177638:54"/> that shall duely and truely pay them vnto such. And this Answere I suppose may giue satisfaction to this third Obiection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To their fourth Argument wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; that First fruites and Oblations,<note place="margin">The .4.

Wherefore according to the Canon; The cause ceasing, the effect, arysing out of the Cause, ceaseth. But as for such kindes of Tythes, by which the poore are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, Christ by a new Law hath rather further confirmed them, then infringed them; when as without limitation of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or proportion, hee commaundeth vs to giue the remainder to the poore; where hee giueth vs this charge:<note place="margin">Luke. 11.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble to theris, the Sword of the Persecutor then raging among them, there were some equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and reason for it.</p>
            <p>In the times of the Apostles, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians sold their Landes, and layde downe the Monies they had receiued for them at the feete of the Apostles:<note place="margin">Act. 4.37.</note> Now will any man thinke that this their deuotion is of necessitie to be drawne into custome and common imitation?</p>
            <p>In the Apostles times, there were no Vniuersities or Societies of Learning: What shall wee therupon breake downe the Carued workes of collegiate Houses with Axes &amp; Hammers, and disseuer their
<pb facs="tcp:177638:56"/> Societies? In the times of the Apostles, there were no Hospitals &amp; Almeshouses for the poore; Shall we thereupon be checked for hauing them? In primitiue times, the sacred Bible remained vndeuided into Chapters and Verses: What of that? that is nothing to vs that haue them thus distinguished vnto vs. In auncienter times there was no distinction made of Parishes: but we need not care for that, this Custome carrying such congruitie with our times. But ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply wee our selues to the cause of Tythes: Some places haue their immunities by themselues, &amp; are not charged with tythes: yet in liew therof, Ministers are there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by as sufficient supplyes. As S. <hi>Paul</hi> tooke no Stipende at all of some for his labours in his calling; in as much as hee brought in his lyuing otherwayes; yet doubteth not to tell them, that by right hee might haue claymed it: and that whatsoeuer hee did for some speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, his examples should not preiudice or defraude others in that which was their due.</p>
            <p>In the like manner wee determine it, that all allowance was made in another kind to them who had not their Tythes in kind, which to those that receiue their Tythes in kind, is not prescribed. And as the aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kinges of the <hi>Persians,</hi> there imposed
<pb facs="tcp:177638:57"/> no Tribute vpon their Subiectes where they came in with their voluntarie beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; which encreased the Kinges Coffers as much as the other: so the examples of such as liue by their sette and certaine Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes, must not be pleaded to the hurt of them, who are supported and susteined by their Tythes.</p>

Albeit Tythes and First fruites seeme to be vnder one kind; yet are they for great cause so distinguished, and deuided betweene themselues, that both of them are not by the same Law to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For, First fruites were a certaine kind of Sacrifice, which was rather to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to God, then to men; that the rest of the Fruites might be sacred and hallowed, by the oblation of these.

The Sacrifice of Christ being satisfactorie and sufficient in it selfe, wee haue now no more need of other Sacrifices, whereby to Worship God; but there is more then need of setting out of Stipendes due to Gods Ministers, for the vpholding of their Profession, whether by the Tenth or Ninth part, or any other fit proportion: vnlesse we list to quench the light of the Gospell, that hath so commaunded it.</p>

            <p>Nay by this fond Conclusion, they would giue vs the Sunne it selfe, were it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Firmament; because many in a blind deuotion, haue fallen downe before it, and worshipped it. Yea put we the case thus; Wee may lay downe our Weapons, and strippe our selues out of our Armour, and goe out naked against the Enimie, for that the treacherous and trayterous sort haue so nefariously abused these, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and destruction of their Common wealth and Nation. Further graunt this Theoreme and Conclusion, and what shall let vs to wring out of Chyrurgians handes their Kniues, Sawes, and such vtensils of theirs, which they vse in extremities vpon putrified members? in as much as vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Emperickes and Dog-leeches, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly vnlearned haue thereby beastly and barbarously butchered such as they haue lighted on. The Philosophers bring all the benefites we enioy, to three generall heads. 1. To the Goods of Fortune. 2. Of the Minde. 3. Of the Body. Of the first kind, are those that are without the man, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hauing his beeing without these, but his better being by them, as Riches, Honor, Friendes, and such like. Of the second sort is the Intellectuall part of man, the inward
<pb facs="tcp:177638:59"/> faculties and indumentes of the Minde. Of the third rancke, are the outward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and abilities of the Body, as Strength, Health, Beautie, and the like. But giue mee one of these that is not intemperately mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used by euery one of vs: Now might their Logicke take place, that such thinges that are giuen vs for good causes, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions sake that we haue cast vpon them, should be taken from vs, there is no other shift for vs then, but to goe out of Nature, and to bid a farewell to all togeather. Wherefore, as they doe but reason absurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that dispute thus; That man is to be depriued of his Meates and Drinkes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath mispent them and abused them: so it is as sottish a sequell, that Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers should be triced of their Tythes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the most part haue no skill or will, well to vse them.</p>
            <p>Thus their principall Obiections being assoiled, I hold, all our Aduersaries can say else, Why Tythes should not be due by the Law of God; not to be worth our answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Simple Negation is answere suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to such Obiections as Fancie hath conceiued: and sylence and sufferance, is the best Apologie to be put in against Petulancie: such as was <hi>Isaacs</hi> to <hi>Ismael.</hi> Wherefore to friuolous reasons wee say no: and to such as are contumelious, we say
<pb facs="tcp:177638:60"/> nothing.</p>
            <p>Now it remayneth that wee vphold the Affirmatiue part, and shew what wee haue to say for our defence of our iust tytle and clayme vnto Tythes:<note place="margin">Reasons in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e behalfe of Tythes, that they are due by Gods law. The first reason.</note> and we dispute thus. Whatsoeuer things haue introduction and foundation both in the Lawes of God, and Nature, are still to be continued: but the Pension and Proportion of Tythes, is of this condition; therefore to be vpholden and continued. The <hi>Minor</hi> and Assumpt of this Syllogisme is thus cleared; for that Naturall reason suggesteth, that such as serue the Common wealth, should liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common Contributions, whether by the Tenth or Eleuenth part, as ye please. To this, all the Stories of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> doe beare witnes, euery Nation plenarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding for their Priestes.

            <p>And that Tythes were of Diuine, as of Humaine sanction and foundation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, in that <hi>Moses</hi> by the instinct and instigation of God, instituted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them: and for that good &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men before the Law, which by the secret direction, and operation of the Spirit, gaue the Tythes of their whole Estate: and for that the most of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> eyther exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Tythes, or otherwise as sufficient a satisfaction to such as were their Priestes.

Hereupon may we safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sufficiently conclude, that Tythes are of Naturall and Diuine Law; and so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be repealed.</p>

               <note place="margin">The 2. Reason for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Tythes.</note>2. Let our second Syllogisme be set out in this sort. That which the Magistrate in a good and vpright iudgement hath orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who hath also Commission so to doe; that is of euery one absolutely to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not to be violated: But whereas a Pension is due to the Ministrie, and the Magistrate liketh best of that Number, that
<pb facs="tcp:177638:61"/> was of Gods institution, then of any other of humane inuention: wee ought all of vs to submit our selues to this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let our third Reason be thus endited.<note place="margin">The 3. Reason for the right of Tythes.</note> Whatsoeuer thinges wee haue receiued on that condition, to pay a part of them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it is iust and right, that out of them, that part should be satisfied. But of all our Reuenewes receiued from God, there is this Condition; That we pay backe a part of them: therefore that we so doe it, is but our duetie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of the Reason is three seuerall wayes prooued. 1. In the behalfe of God, who for no other consideration, hath giuen vs the Fruites and Foyson of the Earth, and all other benefites, then that out of them we should spare and spend something vpon godly vses, to the good of the Church, and enlargement of his Glorie.<note place="margin">Extra. de. dec. c. Cum non sit.</note> Hereupon saith <hi>Innocentius: That God by a speciall Title hath reserued vnto himselfe the Tythes, in signe of an vniuersall dominion and power that he hath ouer all.</hi> Now such thinges are giuen to God, which are ministred to his Seruantes, and to the poore, that belong vnto him.</p>
            <p>And the Lord demandeth of vs not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but worship. And it is a marke of his marueilous munificence, that for the wholo he hath giuen, he requireth as requitall, but the Tenth part againe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:177638:62"/>2. This is also made good on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe who hath bought any Farme of a man, which is put ouer to him, or purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or otherwise by right of descent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but with this Prouiso howsoeuer, to pay the Tenth part of the Profites there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to this or that person. Otherwise there is none so simple, but knoweth that those Farmes that are free of such paimentes and disburcements are of better worth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this cause, Tythes out of those Landes, are due to the Lettor, the profites whereof thou buyest at the cheaper hand.

            <p n="3">3. The third Proofe concerneth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Law it selfe, which determineth a Tyth to be a reall burden, which naturally follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the owner of the Fruits. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Proprietaries &amp; Possessors, are by Lawes enforced to susteine all other burdens that pertaine to Farmes, Mannors, or Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: there is litle equitie in it to wrangle, or be at difference, touching the sole and onely burden of Tythes. Now lay we these togeather into one summe, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that Tythes are of Diuine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine authoritie: that in as much as wee
<pb facs="tcp:177638:62"/> giue, as it is meete we should, what is due to Men, out of the Goodes we enioy: We ought much more to giue vnto God of the Goodes and Commodities that we hold by him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let this be our next Reason.<note place="margin">The 4. Reason for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Tythes.</note> No Pension that is indifferent and tollerable, is to be detained from the common vse: but of this kind and condition are Tythes; therefore we are not at any hand to hold them.</p>

Or otherwise he may be sent to the Schoole of his betters, and by the examples of Worthies afore-times, who haue spent their Liuinges and Liues, for their Countries, take Lesson of imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: of which sort was <hi>Moses,</hi> who with his manhood; <hi>Aaron,</hi> who with his eloquence; <hi>Sampson,</hi> who with his strength; <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> who with their Wisedome, were seruiceable to the places wherein they ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Among the Heathens, wee haue had

               <hi>Curtius, Theseus, Thrasybulus, Aratus, Sycio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> the <hi>Decij,</hi> the <hi>Philerj,</hi> that were bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Demaratus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian, Pierta</hi> Daughter to that famous <hi>Pythus,</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidia</hi> Sister to the Emperour <hi>Honorius;</hi> all which were content to abide all aduentures for the furtheraunce and aduancement of the common good.</p>
            <p>Now the Assumption or <hi>Minor</hi> of this Syllogisme, that the Tenth portion of the Fruites of the Earth, is of middle and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent condition; is easily euicted, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if we shall compare them togeather with exactions and impositions that are of other nature. The <hi>Egiptians</hi> departed with the fift part of their estate vnto their Kings. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> speaketh of a King of <hi>Egipt,</hi> that gaue the yearely Custome of the Fish that came out of Pooles to his Queene to finde her selfe Apparrell; which came to a Talent of Siluer by the day.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Dion</hi> in his Chronicle, in the life of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> relateth, how when as <hi>Augustus</hi> was enforced to maintaine three and twentie Armies, he leuied the twentie

            <p>The <hi>Thuringi</hi> yearely payed ouer to the Kinges of the <hi>Ʋngatinus,</hi> the Tenth number aswell of all their Goods, as of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

               <note place="margin">The 6. reason.</note>6. Wee further argue in this case from the effectes. Whatsoeuer thinges are giuen to the benefite of the giuer and receiuer, are not to be inhibited: But Tythes conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and faythfully performed, are of this effect: Wherefore they are not to be inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited or kept backe. That Tythes benefite the receiuers of them, is generally confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it needeth not to be prooued. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that redoundeth to the Donor or Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is the question, which we must put out of question. <hi>Ramerus</hi> maketh a foure-fold fruite growing out of this Stalke. 1. A greater plentie and encrease of Corne. 2. Health of Bodie. 3. Forgiuenesse of Sinne. 4. Reward in the life to come.</p>
            <p>In the two first, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> giueth sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with him, thus speaking in the cause. <hi>Si decimam dederis, non solum samtatem fructuū, sed et sanitatem corporū consequeris:</hi> By the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tythes, thou shalt obtaine holsome Fruite, and an holsome Body. And in the same Chapter he dilateth vpon the other two effectes thereof; which hauing a good and godly exposition, are not of ordinarie or meane condition. Search the Scriptures,
<pb facs="tcp:177638:64"/> and yee shall see what liberall Promises are made by God to such as walke after his Rule.</p>

               <hi>à contrariò,</hi> from the contrarie consequent, and thus to forme our Argument: If more mishap &amp; misery haue befallen such in their fortunes and affaires, that haue either wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept backe, or fraudulently payed Tythes, then they could haue susteined, if they had performed the fift part: how dare any man by violating this duetie, run vpon the Pike of so great a danger?</p>
            <p>But whether this be so or no, <hi>Augustine</hi> shall tell you who presseth and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth this poynt very much. <hi>Cum deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas dando caelestia ac terrena possis prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reri, pro auaritia tua, duplici benedictione fraudaris:</hi> Whereas by due performance of thy Tythes, thou mayest haue Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Earthly blessinges giuen thee; thou by thy couetousnesse, doest bereaue thy selfe of this double Blessing. <hi>Haec est enim Domini iustissimi consuetudo, vt si tu illi decimam non dederis, tu ad decimam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoceris: dabis impio militi, quod non vis dare sacerdoti:</hi> For this is the proceeding of the righteous Lord, that if thou shalt not giue thy Tyth to him, thou shalt be made to pay thy Tyth: thou shalt giue to a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

If this portion of Tythes, was payable to them that were of inferiour rancke and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: it is much more payable to those whose dignitie and ministrie is greater: Now such is the ministrie of the Gospell, without all comparison, beyond the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Law. The excellencie of the same beyond the other, is layde out by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his latter Letter vnto the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> where the differences are thus made, that the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> Priestes were but Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Letter, and Seruantes of the Cyphers and shadowes: but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were the Ministers of the Spirit of the soule and substance of these shadowes.

            <p>Now, if any shall obiect against Tythes, as the subiect occasion of much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wee send them home that Obiection againe, applying it to their stipendarie Exhibition, which in the imposition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, collection thereof; is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and argument of no small diuision. Wherefore, for that Nature hath taught

               <hi>While it was whole, it was whole thine.</hi> When our Tythes might haue probably seemed our owne, we had colour of libertie to vse them as wee our selues saw good. But hauing made them his whose they are; let vs take warning by other mens exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, what it is to wash or clippe that Come which hath on it the marke of God.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:177638:68"/> But we challenge them in this broad-faced opinion, which is fond and false. 1. For the Labourers Wages is not of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, but of Duetie; Wherefore Tythes being the Wages of the Lordes Workman, they are a plaine debt of the people vnto them. 2. Againe, Almes doe alwayes exceed the desert of him that giueth the Almes, they shew the beneuolence and bountie of the giuer, and not any merit or worth in the receiuer. But Tythes, and all other temporall giftes hold no comparison with trauailes of the Ministers. Wherefore the Apostle maketh a <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:177638:69"/> 4. Againe, the Tenth is as an Inheritance to the Church, and to be counted as the Corne of the Barne: or the aboundance of the Winepresse:<note place="margin">Numb. 18.26.27.</note> it is vnto them as the Fruite of the Earth, and Encrease of the Ground to the Husbandman: therefore to be taken for no Almes from Men, but the blessing of God, both vpon the Pastor, &amp; the People. 5. If Ministers (though bound in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to teach the People,) may also be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and enforced thereunto by the Lawes of the Church; why may not the People in like manner be put to it by compulsion of Law, to performe that dutie to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, to which they are drawne on by the motiue of their conscience? 6. Finally, wee finde by experience enough, how hardly we come by that which is our owne, though the Lawes be so strong as they are on our side: What mercie then could wee expect at mens handes, were they loosed from the Lawes, and set at their owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie?

Thus Tythes are determined to be a Debt, and duetie of Obedience; and therefore not to goe vnder an Almes, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie Beneuolence. The like verdict giueth an other Councell, thus,<note place="margin">Concil. Aquis. granens. lib. 1. cap. 34.</note>

            </p>
            <p>But how commeth it then to passe, may some worthily say, that so contrariant to their owne Canons, they haue made so many impropriate Benefices, and broake through the Classies and Ranckes of their owne Orders?

<pb facs="tcp:177638:76"/> white Plaister of their distinctions, vpon the Mudwall of this turpitude, and foule abomination. First they will say, that by the Canons it was not lawfull for the ciuill Magistrate, to make a Benefice Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; but the Bishop might.

            <p n="2">2. Secondly, they come limping in with this allegation: Howbeit it is not in the power of euery Bishoppe, to alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Church liuinges by alienation; yet the Pope the supreme Bishop hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie so to doe.</p>
            <p>But heere a Canon that includeth the Pope, checketh also this Distinction, which they must satisfie, before they can salue the sore that they haue made: The Canō goeth thus: <hi>If any Bishoppes hereafter,</hi>

But this Bush, behind which they run, will not serue to hide them. 1. For first the great Caution and Prouision made by Lawes, and that so many of that kind, against Lay men to hold Tythes, doth not obscurely shew, that it was a common tricke in Poperie, to alienate the profites of the Church to such persons. 2. Also, their owne Canons are against it, that Tythes or Benefices should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidated or vnited to Churches, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Houses of Religion.</p>

            <p>The stone in the Bladder is a greiuous disease, and so is that which is in the Raines: But the stone about the Heart is most to be feared: Yea, it is much to be feared, that it will drawe the whole man with the waight of it into Hell. For as those thinges that are hard, are also in their owne nature heauie, as it is in a Stone, which being throwne

And therein hee playeth the Part of an old practised Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler with vs, who hauing a great Fish vpon his Hooke, forceth not hastily to heaue him vp to the shoare, but dallieth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him length enough of line to skudde vp and downe, &amp; to swallow vp the baite, thereby to make him sure, least otherwise by dealing too rigorously with him, hee might breake his Line, and loose all togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sathan doth not presently surprize a sinner, whom with the Hooke of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath caught; but he suffereth him to approoue and put in practise many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dueties.

So when he had goten a <hi>Pharisie</hi> by the Gilles,<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> he made good sport with him, fancying wel enough his double Fastes by the weeke, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable Tything, and his minde not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with many notorious and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious improbities; all these being nothing better then sweete Baites, to feed his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and vaineglorious humour.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note>As <hi>Pharo</hi> suffered the <hi>Israelites</hi> to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God; yet with this cautelous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision and restriction, that they should not goe farre, nor carry away their Children, or the Cattell with them; but that leauing these Pledges of their loue behinde them, their mindes might be setled on a returne to him againe. So the Diuell as an other <hi>Pharo,</hi> doth thus capitulate, and indent with vs, howsoeuer wee depart in some manner from him, yet that we shew, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum reuertendj,</hi> a purpose of returning, by leauing some Pawne of sinfull affections in this our enimies hand.</p>
            <p>The Diuell playeth with a man, as a young Child with a Bird, which hee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to flie by the length of his Threed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened to his Legges, plucking him home

            <p>But as Christ did cast out the whole Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Diuels;<note place="margin">Luc. 8.</note> so wee must cast out the whole Hoast of sinne, and not suffer any one to remaine in our Campe.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Pharo</hi> and his whole Armie perished by Sea; so in <hi>Mare amaro,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> in the salt and brackish Waters of our Repentance, are we to drowne the whole vnited power of our sinnes, and not to suffer any one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine aliue. One sinne is enough to keepe vs out of Heauen: For if a Bird hath but one foote entangled, she is not able to flie; so if we haue our heart but ensnared with one sinne, wee shall neuer be able to soare vp to Heauen.</p>
            <p>The Leprous person,<note place="margin">Leuit. 14.</note> who was to be clensed, was by Law enioyned to shaue off euery Haire of his head: Wherefore thou that hast the spirituall Leprosie of sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, must by office of duetie, shredde and shaue off euery sinne that cleaueth fast vnto thee; and so this sinne of Sacriledge shalbe done away.</p>
            <p>Now we, though we could be content, that we might not seeme couetous with a part of our owne, with some honest allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce
<pb facs="tcp:177638:102"/> out of the whole, most vnhonestly and shamefully detained from vs: yet if yee will haue so much grace as <hi>Judas,</hi> yee must restore the whole: yea, yee must call to God for mercy in the face of his annointed, for the harme yee haue done his Prophets hitherto: Wherefore on with thy Sacke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath,<note place="margin">2.
